  <h1>Rosario</h1>
  <p>Rosario is an omnibus type that was originally developed in 2003 for private use. It was designed by Hector Gatti and was named after his home city, Rosario, Argentina. It is an elegant font with classic proportions, subtle contrast, and weak endings. It is an ideal font for magazines and academic journals.</p>
