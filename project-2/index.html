                All About Pokémon Soul Silver!</h1>
        <p>Pokémon Soul Silver is paired with Pokémon Heart Gold and they are actually a remake of the original 1999 Gameboy games, Pokémon Silver and Gold.  These games were released on September 12, 2009  by Game Freak for the Nintendo DS and are considered part of the 4th generation. Soul Silver takes place in the Johto region and features tons of Pokémon unique to that area.

            The game starts out with the player choosing the gender and name of their character and then walking over to Professor Elm’s lab, and this is when the fun begins. The player is prompted to choose one of 3 Pokémon shown on the screen. These are known as the starter Pokémon. In Soul Silver, there are 3 options. There is Cyndaquil, a fire type, then Chikorita, a grass type, and thirdly (and my personal favorite) Totodile, a water type. 
            
            The player is then able to advance to other parts of the region and battle to their hearts content while collecting every type of Pokémon to complete the Pokédex. 
            
            The player’s main goal is to defeat Team Rocket and capture the legendary Pokémon, Lugia (the pokemon on the game’s cover + title screen). Once captured the player becomes the ultimate Pokémon trainer. </p>
