                    <p>
                        Bugsy is the leader of the Bug-type gym in Azalea town, Johto. When defeated, the player will receive the Hive badge. He appears in Generations II, IV, and V. He made his debut appearance in the Pokémon Gold and Silver games. He also appears  Pokémon the series (the anime), in the 144th episode named “Gettin’ the Bugs out”. This episode premiered on March 17, 2001 in the US and on April 20, 2000 in Japan. He also makes an appearance in Pokémon masters (a mobile game), and Pokémon adventures (the manga). 

His physical appearance is a purple, slightly more feminine bob,  and purple eyes. However, his eyes can also be more of a grey/brown depending on the age of the game or anime. He wears a green shirt tucked into some green shorts, complete with a brown belt. He also has white knee socks, brown shoes, and a yellow handkerchief. This handkerchief is part of his newer design, along side the brown belt. The belt is seen as black in the older designs of the character. He is also seen holding a net that is slightly taller than himself. In Heart Gold and Soul Silver, his appearance slightly changes. In these games he is seen with a shirt that has different shades of green, a neckerchief, and yellow striped knee socks. 

When the player is ready to take on this bug crazed gym leader, they must first defeat Team Rocket upon entering Slowpoke Well. If the player desires to win their Hive badge, the best Pokémon types to bring along are fire, flying, and rock types. Bug types are especially weak to these which will cause double damage to the bug Pokémon, giving the player an advantage. However, Bugsy’s attack patterns can get annoying if the player is not ready. His technique is described as unpredictable but of course effective for him. His main Pokémon is Scyther and his signature move is Fury Cutter. 

Upon defeating this gym the player will receive the Hive badge and the move TM 49: Fury Cutter to have a compatible Pokémon learn.
