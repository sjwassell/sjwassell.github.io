                        You enter a strange world full of mythical creatures with powers and questionably people with even more questionable morals. Unfortunately, since this is 2009, you can only be a boy or a girl. Sorry non-binary people. But get your bag and go outside because you have to pick your Pokémon! That’s right, you get to have a strange animal being follow you around and be your friend! You are getting your very own Pokémon today, which are you going to choose? The swift grass type, Chikorita? The feisty fire type, Cyndaquil? Or maybe the ferocious water type, Totodile? Once you’ve picked one, go on! Get out and explore! Here’s some pokéballs, catch’em all!  

You have to become the best and catch the all mighty, legendary Lugia! You can do it, it can’t be that hard. 

But first....

Leave your home in New Bark Town and defeat a number of gym leaders, such as Bugsy, to achieve your goal of collecting all of the gym leaders’ badges! When you’ve got all of them, people will know that you’re really cool and taught those leaders a lesson! 

But wait a minute! Is that Team Rocket? Oh No! You must foil their evil plot of taking over the radio tower to contact their leader, Giovanni. We can’t let them win at whatever they’re trying to do this time! 

Remember that childhood best friend you had?  Well, now he/she is your rival! He/she will pick a different Pokémon than you and try to battle you almost every time they see you! Kind of annoying, right? But don’t worry, you’ll probably win anyways, they aren’t ever very strong. 

Welcome to the world of Pokémon, where you fight to victory! Since you aren’t an NPC, you’ll probably achieve that! Get ready to challenge, collect, talk to random NPC’s that you thought were going to fight you, and become best friends with your Pokémon! Have fun and don’t let your rival’s ego get the best of you!
